            title1:
              "Deciding on a mobile development framework often boils down to ‘Flutter vs React Native’. Understanding their differences in performance, development experience, and ecosystem support is crucial. Our straightforward comparison strips away the fluff and dives into what you need to know to choose the right tech for your app.",
            sub_para1:
              "In the past there weren’t many options to choose from, developers were stuck with building native applications, using either Java or Android SDK for Android, or Swift for iOS. Nowadays, there are many cross-platform development frameworks available. However, this means that you have to make an important choice before you pick one. This won’t be easy and you will need to consider at least two factors.",
            sub_para2:
              "First, there’s the budget. Building a cross-platform app tends to be cheaper than developing two separate ones for each major mobile OS. Second, there’s complexity. Although cross-platform application development is cheaper and faster, implementing a very complex logic or hardware integrations can be prohibitively difficult in non-native dev scenarios.",

              "Flutter and React Native are open-source frameworks created by Google and Meta Platforms, respectively, aimed at facilitating high-performance, cross-platform app development with a single codebase.",
            sub_paraT2_2:
              "React Native has a larger ecosystem and stronger community support, but Flutter is rising in popularity and might have better performance due to features like direct compilation into native code and efficient rendering.",
